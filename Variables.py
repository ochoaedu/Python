#Variables in python are like boxes where you can store different data types
#but those values can change during the program execution

name = "Eduardo" #this is a variable definition

string = "Welcome to Python"

phrase = string + " " + name #using the + symbol means concatenation of the values contained in the variables. 
print(phrase)


num1 = 5

num2 = 7

print(num1+num2) #but the + character can also be used as an addition operator.
